"""
[unfinished]
1) Create the Binary Search Tree Class and a Node Class
2) Implement the Search Method in the BST with True/False
3) Implement the Insertion Method in the BST
4) How would you delete a node? What to think about???
5) How would you traverse through it â€¦ create a method that helps us print the tree. (There are 3 types: pre-order, post-order, in-order)
6) Return a sorted list from BST method
