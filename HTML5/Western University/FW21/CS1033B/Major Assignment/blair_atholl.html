  <p>In the year 2018, I went to an international jamborette in Scotland called <a title="Blair Atholl" href="https://www.bpblairatholl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blair Atholl</a> with my Scouts group. It is a 9-day jamborette in&nbsp;Scotland. The jamborette is host to about 1500 people consisting of Local and International Scouts from 20 other countries.</p>

  <td style="width: 1000px;">
  <p>Our scout troop spent about 3 weeks in Scotland and Ireland, both before and after the jamborette so we could explore and visit some well-known tourist places as, well, we were pretty much tourists.</p>

  <p>Although I don't have that many pictures from the trip, as they're either in some hard drive back home or lost, some of the pictures I do have will be below with a brief description of them under the pictures. However, I will blur the faces of people in them for the sake of their privacy as well as mine, that being said, I will not be listing them on the references page. However, if you really wanted you could probably search it up, in which case, if you did that's kinda weird and you should really check your priorities if you're trying to find pictures of someone on the internet.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">This picture was taken by one of the parents before we went and checked into our terminal at the airport. This was the day that we would go to a foreign country for the next 3 weeks and attend the biggest camp we'd ever been to yet. It was exciting but scary, and a little sad if I'm gonna be honest. Yeah, I'd been away from home and away from my parents for a couple of nights but never for 3 weeks, especially in another country, but hey, there's always a time for something new.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">This is a picture of how the site looked, or at least part of it. The circles of tents you see are mini communities of people we were put into. There was a total of 6 if i recall correctly. Every group of 2 tents in that circle was 1 group of scouts in that community. There'd be 2-3 Scottish scouts of each gender in each tent, and there would be 2-3 of us in each tent depending on gender. Those circles of tents would be who we'd interact with on the daily for the next 9 days. And yes we were able to visit other circles and go to events that the jamborette hosted, more info can be found on their website <a title="Blair Atholl" href="https://www.bpblairatholl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">This picture shows us at a table serving pancakes. The context behind this is that there was one day during the jamborette which pretty much served as a food festival, where the scouts from all 20 international countries would make food from their respective countries, and us being from Canada, we made pancakes with maple syrup. Surprisingly we had a bunch of people from different countries come over to our stand to try out Canadian pancakes.</p>
