  <p>Up until I can remember, I've been to Ireland, Scotland, China, the United States, and Hong Kong. Weirdly enough I can't find any images of my travels there aside from Scotland, Google Drive does me dirty sometimes so it's probably in some hard drive at my house.</p>

  <td>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/kaiping.png" alt="Kaiping Village" /><br />China - Kaiping Village</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">This is the village that my mom grew up in, back when my mom's side grandmother lived there, my family would visit every summer or two. Kaiping is really great for its street food and traditional feeling streets and atmosphere. Although it definitely isn't a place for<br />everyone, as it's typically pretty hot and humid and there are tons of mosquitos, it's a pretty nice trip every time we go back</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/seattle.png" alt="Seattle Great Wheel" /><br />United States - Seattle</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">A couple of years ago I went to Seattle to stay at a relative's house for a baby shower. My family stayed there for around 2 months<br />so we had time to socialize and spend time with the other relatives that were there. although it wasn't too different from downtown<br />Toronto (where I'm from), I did get the chance to get on the Seattle great wheel and I know what you're probably thinking.<br />"Isn't that just a regular Ferris Wheel?" no. absolutely not. it's the&nbsp;<strong>Seattle Great Ferris Wheel</strong>.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/hk.png" alt="Hong Kong" /><br />Hongkong</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">A long time ago, many years ago, I went to Hongkong on a trip to visit some relatives, it was after one of the china trips, although I fail to remember which one in particular. at the time, however, I had two brothers living in hong kong so I was able to visit both of them and their homes.</p>
