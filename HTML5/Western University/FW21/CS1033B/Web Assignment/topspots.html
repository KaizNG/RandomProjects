  <p>Obviously, Western's campus is absolutely huge, so there's probably a bunch of spots that people like going to. I mean, the campus is beautiful, with tons and tons of buildings and tons of places to discover. Like I found out not too long ago that we have a power plant on our campus. Anyways, my favourite spots for others to discover on campus are as follows.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">This one's kind of a grey area in terms of its campus-ness, but it's pretty great having a Subway, or any fast food place really.<br />When you don't feel like eating cafe food, having another good source of legit food is always great. Plus, because it's a little<br />further than the UCC, there's usually not that long of a line, which, when you're pretty much starving, is a really nice bonus<br />for maybe a bit more of a walk.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"></p>Home sweet home right? This one might not apply to you if you live at a hall that isn't called The Zoo. All jokes aside, I love<br />this place sometimes,it's home, I get to sleep and eat and do all the things I want to do all in my own living space. I mean<br />isn't that what home is supposed to be?</p>

  <p><img src="images/ucc.png" alt="The University Community Centre" title="The University Community Centre"/><br /><strong>Favourite place to wander.</strong></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"></p>This isn't really specific to the UCC building, but I do enjoy wandering around the area of UCC. This area makes for good<br />walks at night when they're IDing everyone at the hall and there's a line that goes up the street and you need something to do<br />in the meantime. There's also a good number of places to eat there so that's a nice bonus.</p>
